abstract: Recent research on Heart Rate Variability (HRV) has proven that Poincare Plot is a powerful tool to mark Short Term and Long Term Heart Rate Variability. This study focuses a comprehensive characterization of HRV among the Tea Garden Workers of the Northern Hilly Regions of West Bengal. The characterization, as available from the data sets, projects the average values of SD1 characteristics, that is, Short Term HRV in females as 58.265ms and SD2 as 149.474. The SDRR shows a mean value of 87.298 with a standard deviation of 119.669 and the S Characterization as 16505.99 ms and Standard deviation of 45882.31 ms. The SDRR shows a mean value of 87.298 with a standard deviation of 119.669 and the S Characterization as 16505.99 ms and Standard deviation of 45882.31 ms. ApEn Characterization showed mean value of 0.961 and standard deviation of 0.274.
