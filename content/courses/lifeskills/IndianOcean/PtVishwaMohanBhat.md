## Indian Ocean ft. Pt. Vishwamohan Bhatt | Charkha

### The making of Charkha

{{<youtube 4roRsfajaM8>}}

## Summary

Indian Ocean have been one of India's most prolific bands over the past 2 decades. This year they mark their 25th year with their biggest album yet. Titled Tandanu, the album features 7 new tracks with 7 different collaborators. Each track also has an exclusive "Making Of" video with behind the scenes footage of the band jamming and brainstorming with the artists.

The fifth song on the project sees Indian Ocean collaborate with one of the Grammy Award winning artist Pt. Vishwamohan Bhatt. The vocal lines in this song are partly influenced by a collaboration they did with four Santhali musicians in 2013. But Pt. Vishwa Mohan Bhatt took the vocal lines in a new direction, and they ended up with a highspeed climax in the Hindustani Classical mode. Their longtime lyricist Sanjeev Sharma interpreted the music to be about the circle of life and creation, hence the name. This is the only song on the album to be recorded without a metronome. Panditji's mastery of the Mohan Veena certainly stretched the band to the limit of their playing abilities!
