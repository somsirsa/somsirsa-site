## Indian Ocean ft. Shubha Mudgal | Gar Ho Sake

### The making of Gar Ho Sake

{{<youtube qhRR6K_UrxM>}}

## Summary

Indian Ocean have been one of India's most prolific bands over the past 2 decades. This year they mark their 25th year with their biggest album yet. Titled Tandanu, the album features 7 new tracks with 7 different collaborators. Each track also has an exclusive "Making Of" video with behind the scenes footage of the band jamming and brainstorming with the artists.

This first episode features the track "Gar Ho Sake" done with Shubha Mudgal. This powerful and moving song is one of the anthems of people's movements in north India, and as such was familiar to Amit, Rahul, and of course, to Shubhaji. And, shockingly, the poet is unknown!

We had originally planned to do a completely different song with Shubhaji, a Kabir Das composition, but it didn't quite take off. Amit Kilam suggested Gar Ho Sake, and instant magic happened. We have changed parts of songs, changing scales, but have kept the basic tune intact in the beginning.

The song literally translates to: If possible, light a lamp to dispel the darkness of this oppressive state.
