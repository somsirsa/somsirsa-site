## Characteristics of The Cleaner

There is so much information that you lose out
Pick and choose one who resonates you
People around you have to be smarter than you
They don't want motivation!

Cooler - good at what they do
Closer - exceptions
Cleaner - end result delivered - no matter what variable is thrown at them - don't bring personal things to work.

## Thinking Style of The Cleaner

- You keep pushing yourself harder when everybody else have had enough
- You get into the zone - you control the uncontrollable - It is about clarity - LEARN HOW NOT TO THINK - their instincts trusts them
- you know exactly who you are
- you trust very few people those better never let you down - create distance - distance has to become your best friend
- its only a failure if you decide it is a failure - No is the start of a conversation - talent + intelligence  + competitiveness + resiliency
- you never celebrate your achievements - because its never enough - winning is an addiction - trade your addiction
- Work smarter AND harder - how to be effective - you have to be obsessive - you have to be addicted - you have to be disciplined - STOP looking for help from everybody else
- YOU change your own identity
- Everybody has a dark side that refuses you to be taught to be good - know how to use it - control it - it keeps your fire lit - harness and acknowledge it - when they take the mask off - that's who they really are
- you are not intimidated by pressure, most people decide not to - stress is just pressure you don't deal with

- **there is never the right time for the truth but truth needs to be heard**

- in emergency they are looking for you to take lead - they don't count days, they make days count
- passion an drive needs to follow by actions
- Decisions vs Suggestions
- you don't have to love the work but you should be addicted to the results
- competitors are feared - add resistance - they always want more
