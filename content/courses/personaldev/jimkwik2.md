**Why are children better learners?**

**Information with Emotions form long term memory.**
We are not logical but biological.

 **Neuroplasticity:** Theta state of creativity - when we shower - we can create that state

Idea that one person can make a difference - superheroes have superpowers - unique skills 

**As your body moves, your body grooves**

Peace, Love, Joy (hugs, kisses, ), Compassion are highest mental states.

### Learning is not a spectator sport:

* **Be fast**
* Be responsible for how you feel.
    * Be a thermostat instead of being a thermometer (Believe) All behavior is Belief driven - visualization
* Exercise (Physical Exercise)
* Forget (Don't be Know it all)
* Active (Learning is not a spectator sport) - ask questions
* State (All learning is state dependent)
* Teach (Learn with the intention to teach)
