## Learning Fast

{{<youtube Y1e38mkTfRA>}}

### Summary

*In this talk from Mindvalley Live 2019 in Los Angeles, Jim Kwik the author of Mindvalley's Superbrain and learning expert gives his talk on how we can actually learn faster by taking the information we read in faster and more effectively.*

## **Key Points from the Talk:**

**Head, Heart, Hand: Information** (i.e. we get from podcasts, books) must be added with **Inspiration** (i.e. why we do what we want to do) to lead to **Implementation** (i.e. how we act on it), thereby causing **Integration.**  

Who is counting on me to do my best?

**Confidence-Competence loop**: The more competence at anything will boost your confidence which will empower you to be more competent.

**Reasons Reap Results. Genius leaves clues**: Dr. B.J. Fogg - How to break old habits? - Your life is hidden in your daily routines.

Put First Things First: Learn with the intention of teaching.

Sharpen the Saw (7th habit of Highly Effective People - Steven Covey)

Things that keep you as a slow reader:

* Learn with the intention of teaching
* Lack of education (i.e. How to read?)
    ** upgrade reading skills
* Lack of Focus - because we read slow  
    ** (Reading fast increases focus which helps better comprehension)
* Subvocalisation - reduce it  
    ** use visual pacer (like fingers / mouse)
