# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)

bio: Wish to pitch a business idea or a project successfully? Then be ready to put your mind and body on display. Quite a bold statement isn’t it? Well that’s what I believe in. An idea only remains an idea unless it’s articulated with apt body language. Ever wondered what differentiates an exceptionally great idea that gets across the table from another exceptionally great idea that never gets on board? Well there comes the role of using your extraordinary communication skills paired with charismatic body language.

With the speed at which technology is advancing, what a student faces at the moment is to keep up with it. But how do they do it? How can mentors guide them?

Project Synergy, spearheaded by the AIML society in collaboration with various other departments like Humanities, MBA, etc. is a multidisciplinary agile framework that would integrate Academia with Industry providing real-world experience to our students.

At Synergy, we are currently under the process of developing an integrated platform for Students, Mentors, and Industry Experts. Through this platform, students can have a taste of what the actual industry requires from the young workforces and also the industry experts can pick up interns and even future employees by working closely with our students on live projects and workshops.

We propose to invest time and infrastructure in students who require the right guidance and a little push. We plan to create multidisciplinary teams and provide them with the experience and guidance from the mentors as well as industry experts so that they understand the significance of project-based learning and open-source collaboration with other developers.

We believe if students are exposed to a corporate lifestyle beforehand, they could excel at job interviews, technical rounds, hackathons, internships and many other stages of their professional journey.
