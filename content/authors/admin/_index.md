## Motto

In the words of George Bernard Shaw,

"This is a true joy in life, being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one, being a true force of Nature instead of a feverish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making you happy. I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community, and, as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. 

I want to be thoroughly used up when I die. For the harder I work, the more I live. I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no brief candle to me. It is a sort of slendid torch which Iâ€™ve got to hold up for the moment and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to  future generations."
